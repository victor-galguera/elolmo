# jQuery Migrate 3.x

## Overview

jQuery Migrate 3.x restores the API that was removed in the jQuery 3.x, previously marked as deprecated. Without it the breaking changes introduced by jQuery 3.x may break your site.

It includes the Development version of the jQuery Migrate 3.1.0 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/tree/3.1.0) as a dependency of the jQuery so it is included right after the jQuery library.

Drupal 8.4 introduces jQuery 3.x that replaces jQuery 2.x, so the the jQuery Migrate 3.1.0 is included only if the jQuery version used is >= 3.0 and < 4.0.
